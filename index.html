The discovery of that the universe is expanding changed our understanding towards cosmology. Mathematics provides the tools to descried this expansion, 
from the geometry of spacetime to equations governing cosmic evolution. This article tells us about the mathematical components underlying our expanding universe. 
Using general relativity as the foundation, the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric models the large-scale structure of spacetime. The scale factor 
describes how distance grows with time that links directly to Hubble’s Law, which relates to decline velocity to distance. The Friedmann equation the connects expansion 
to energy density, curvature, and dark energy. Observational proof-such as redshift measurements, the cosmic microwaves background, and supernova surveys-confirms these 
mathematical predictions. Understanding these equations is essential for interpreting the past and the future behaviour of the universe. This article summarizes the 
mathematical framework behind cosmic expansion.
