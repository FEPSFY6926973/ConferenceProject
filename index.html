The discovery of that the universe is expanding changed our understanding towards cosmology. Mathematics provides the tools to descried this expansion, 
from the geometry of spacetime to equations governing cosmic evolution. This article tells us about the mathematical components underlying our expanding universe. 
Using general relativity as the foundation, the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric models the large-scale structure of spacetime. The scale factor 
describes how distance grows with time that links directly to Hubble’s Law, which relates to decline velocity to distance. The Friedmann equation the connects expansion 
to energy density, curvature, and dark energy. Observational proof-such as redshift measurements, the cosmic microwaves background, and supernova surveys-confirms these 
mathematical predictions. Understanding these equations is essential for interpreting the past and the future behaviour of the universe. This article summarizes the 
mathematical framework behind cosmic expansion.

<h4><b>2.1 Evidence for Expansion</b></h4>
The idea of an expanding universe originates from Edwin Hubble’s 1929 observations that galaxies appear to be moving away from us at speeds relative to their 
distances (Hubble, 1929). This linear relationship provided the first quantitative evidence against the previously assumed static universe. Later analyses 
confirmed that this recession is not due to galaxies moving through space, but rather space itself expanding (Harrison, 2000). These measurements inspired 
mathematicians and physicists to develop models that could describe such large-scale behaviour.

<h4><b>2.2 Geometry and the Metric</b></h4>
The mathematics used to describe the universe is based on general relativity, Einstein’s theory that gravity results from the curvature of spacetime. To model the universe, 
cosmologists assume homogeneity and isotropy at large scales, a principle known as the cosmological principle (Peacock, 1999).
